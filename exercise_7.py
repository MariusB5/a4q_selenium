# Same as exercise 6 but now as the user is successfully logged in, a partial screen capture of the third item
# on the inventory list (with its product description and the add to card button) will be taken and saved to the
# main project directory under the filename inventory_3.png.
# Example of the main project directory is C:\Users\<Your UserName>\PycharmProjects\<Your project
# name>\<your subfolder>
