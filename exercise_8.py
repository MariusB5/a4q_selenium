# Same as exercise 7 but now the browser will be launched in headless mode. After login, a new tab will be
# opened to navigate to ‘https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html’. After navigation, the context will switch back
# to the original tab and a partial screen capture of the third item on the inventory list (with its product
# description and the add to card button) will be taken and saved as inventory_three.png in the main project
# directory.
# Example of the main project directory is C:\Users\<Your UserName>\PycharmProjects\<Your project
# name>\<your subfolder>
